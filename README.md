# PlayingWithMusic
This repo is for music related experiments and exploring game and app ideas that involve music. Basically anything involving music where it doesn't yet have a full clear concept that we're going for, can have a place in this repo. Maybe you've been playing on a music creation tool and made a tune you'd want to use somewhere but don't have a use for it. Or maybe you've had part of an idea for a music making game or app, and want to just do a small bit of playing around with that idea to see if it's worth making a project out of it. Either way, you're welcome to add new files or directories to this repo.

#Why did we make this
The two community mods had been chatting and ideating around the theme of music. We came up with a few concepts and had some seeds of inspiration that could form a few different but related projects. Phil decided rather than launch into one of those ideas, he'd start a repo for just playing with these ideas. Why? Because he liked each of the ideas a bit, but didn't have a favourite - he can see that theres some good things in that set of ideas but can't picture a clear standout vision. So we should mull on this, and explore a few different paths from those ideas and inspiration, and maybe creativity and passion will guide us.
